{"coordinates":"pkg:maven/org.antlr/ST4@4.0.8","description":"StringTemplate is a java template engine for generating source code,\nweb pages, emails, or any other formatted text output.\n\nStringTemplate is particularly good at multi-targeted code generators,\nmultiple site skins, and internationalization/localization. \n\nIt evolved over years of effort developing jGuru.com. \n\nStringTemplate also generates the stringtemplate website: http://www.stringtemplate.org\nand powers the ANTLR v3 code generator. Its distinguishing characteristic \nis that unlike other engines, it strictly enforces model-view separation.\n\nStrict separation makes websites and code generators more flexible\nand maintainable; it also provides an excellent defense against malicious\ntemplate authors.\n\nThere are currently about 600 StringTemplate source downloads a month.","reference":"https://ossindex.sonatype.org/component/pkg:maven/org.antlr/ST4@4.0.8?utm_source\u003ddependency-check\u0026utm_medium\u003dintegration\u0026utm_content\u003d6.4.1","vulnerabilities":[]}
